You will have to place the file in front of any -l options , here for an example:

g++ X.cpp -lX11 -lGL -lGLU -lglut -g -Wall -O2 -o X

Also make sure the following packages is already present:

sudo apt-get install mesa-common-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev

And ensure glx module is loaded in Xorg

Section "Module"
    Load "glx"
EndSection
Good luck with OpenGL programming !
